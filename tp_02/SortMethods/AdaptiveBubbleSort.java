     * !  Adaptive Bubble sort -unlike simple bubble sort- does recognize if the array is already ordered o semi ordered,
     *    by cheking if any of the elements in the array has been "swapped" during the first round.
     *    So, in this case -the better case-, it reduces the complexity from 0(n^2) to 0(n), as it improves the
     *    complexicity in other cases, acording to the quantity of elements in the array that needs to be swapped.
     *
     * @param arr
     * @return ascending ordered arr
